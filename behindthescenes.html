            <h2>Our Pitch</h2>
            <p>We came up with the idea for this site on a typical night in 2015 when we couldn't think of a TV show to watch. Everyone wanted to watch TV, but no one could agree on a show. Brittany wanted to watch an episode of Rugrats, Samantha wanted to watch That's So Raven, and Brett wanted to watch The Real World. We searched online for a site that would give us ideas for shows we might all enjoy, but we couldn't find a single site like that! That's when the light bulb went off for all three of us. If that site didn't exist, why not create it ourselves?? We didn't sleep for two weeks straight; instead we wrote TV show reviews and coded this website. We hope you enjoy the fruits of our labor and find a great new TV show to watch with your friends, family, roommates, etc. Happy viewing!</p>

                    <p>Brittany is our fearless leader. She organizes us and makes sure everyone stays on task and hits their deadlines.</p>

                    <p>Samantha is in charge of selecting the TV shows to include on the site. She watches more TV than is probably healthy, but she loves her job, and we're glad she does it!</p>

                    <p>Brett is the reason you (and millions of others) know our site. His job is to advertise the site and work on partnerships that grow the audience. Tell a friend about the site and make his life easier!</p>
